# Usage

The website should be pretty straight-forward.
To export your schedule to Google Calendar, click: "<span dir="rtl">ייצוא ל-Apple/Google Calendar</span>".
You will download an ICS file, which you can import to [Google calendar](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37118?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop), [Apple calendar](https://support.apple.com/en-il/guide/calendar/icl1023/mac) (or most other calendars as well).

# Developing

To start developing Dib It, you need to follow these steps:

- Clone the repository and install the dependencies with `bun install` (or `npm install` or `yarn install`).
- Create a Firebase project and enable Google authentication and Cloud Firestore.
- Create a web app in the Firebase Console and put the configuration in `src/firebase.json`.
- Run a local development server with `bun run dev` (or `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`)

Run `bun run typecheck`, `bun run lint`, and `bun test` before submitting changes.
The build checks both TypeScript configs and rejects explicit or unsafe `any` usage.
Zod schemas in `src/schemas.ts` validate external data before it reaches app state.
The install script compiles the source-only schedule dependency with its own config;
our app uses its generated declarations without relaxing application checks.
